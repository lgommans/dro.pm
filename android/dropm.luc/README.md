# Android app for dro.pm

Tested on Android 4.1, 4.4, 5.1, and 7.0.

## Features

In the share menu you can select dro.pm to upload a file. Sharing text or links
does not work yet, I still have to find a moment to implement this.

## Contributing

The only file you really need to look at is main.java, which is a symlink to
`src/*/*/*/*/*.java`.

Contributions of any kind are welcome. Especially implementing the "share link"
and "share text" features are welcome, but if you just want to contribute an
icon, that's great too. If you have questions regarding the code or dro.pm's
API, please open an issue or see lucgommans.nl for other contact methods.

For the code license, see the license file at the root of this repository.
